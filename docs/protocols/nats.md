# NATS application performance testing

The samplers for NATS utilize the [nats.java](https://github.com/nats-io/nats.java) library and is required for them to run.

Download the latest `.jar` file (to be safe, download the newest version but below v3.0.0 since depending on the change it might break the template) which can be found on their GitHub page.

Place the `.jar` file in the location where you installed your JMeter application under `<Install location>/lib`.
